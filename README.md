# M00757253
This is a Repository containing code to animate LEDs using Fade_Candy
Within this folder there is a variety of animations an code for the interface you will use to pick them and the necessary libraries you need to make it run correctly. 

To use this code you will need:-
- Any version on Python 3 ie. Python 3.1,3.2 etc 
- Up to to date modules and appropriate files such as:-
    - Tkinter 
    - Random
    - Final.py
    - colourdict.py
    - opc.py
    - simulator file


Random and Tkinter are installed with the latest version of python.
Make sure the .py files are in the downloaded folder.

- The whole folder must be dowloaded, this is because it contains some libraries that make it necessary for the program to work, not only that the folder contains the simulator,
which shows a virtual 60x6 grid of LEDs in which you are going to view the various animations on. 
- To view the 'simulator' open the downloaded file titled "M00757253" look for a file whithin called "simulator". Once in that file, enter on bin and pick the operating system that applies to you. Once you do that double click the file named "readopcForStrands" This should open the simulator.
- After this has been opened in its own window, open the Folder titled "M00757253".
- Within this folder is one named "Submission", and with that folder is a file titled "Final". Double click this file to begin, and click on what you wish to play on the simulator.

- While running another window will pop up displaying some prints I used in order to assist me in the development of this code.

Some buttons are unavailable due to the developmental issues.
