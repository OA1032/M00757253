~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Fun_with_Flags~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
used the TK inter GUI to get the user to input a three didgit username to make a high score list possibly?? How do???? Database required?
Have a few options to select icons of flags attatched to a numbered input. more than 5 or six flags.
when the user chooses a flag print by inputting the number next to the associated flag on Tkinter print it on the fade candy LED's.
( if number isn't) part of the suggested numbers prompt them again and if they use letters or special characters do the same.
make the flag size 30x6
first print the background of the flag (Rectangle, sqquares only)
Then print the foreground using array manipulation and for loops
Prompt the user to guess the name of the country associated with thnat flag. 
If they get it correct project a circle(hollow maybe) tick onto the LED's and ask the user to pick another flag.
If they choose incorrectly project a red X in a (hollow circle) onto the LED's
display a small x onto the corner of the screen or on Tk inter. 3 x's before all the flags are corrextly guessed == Game over
